<h2> MY LIFE JOURNEY </h2>

<div align="center" >
    <p style="font-size: 17px;" style="font-family: Century Gorthic;"> Since I did not explain much about my experiences in my video, why not I clear up it to you here!</p>

<div align="center" style=" letter-spacing: 3px;"><b> Since 2016 until now </b> 
	<p>Cashier</p>

<div align="center" style=" letter-spacing: 3px;">
    <p> My father opened a grocery store in 2013 when he began operating his business. Therefore, I've chosen to undertake a part-time job with him while I'm in school and a full-time job with him during school holidays or semester breaks. I work there from 6 p.m. to 12 a.m. as a cashier.  Not only that, but everytime my father restocks the store, I am in charge of reorganising the merchandise. </p>

<div align="center"><b> January - December 2021 </b> 
    <p>Secretary of PTARC</p>

<div align="center" style=" letter-spacing: 3px;">
	<p><b> On 1 January 2021, </b> I officially become a secretary of Perpustakaan Tengku Anis Reader's Club for one year (two semester). Being a secretary trained me and shaped me into a person with excellent communication skills, a desire to work in a team, and strong leadership abilities. I enjoyed working as a secretary because it has been one of my dreams since elementary school to establish a club and activities. In addition, I can make new acquaintances at university and improve my social skills by interacting with them!</p>
